A Go command-line tool for text processing, correction, and formatting.  
It reads an input file, applies automatic corrections (number conversions, case changes, punctuation normalization, quote formatting, article correction), and outputs a cleaned file.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Hexadecimal → Decimal conversion**  
  Example: `42 (hex)` → `66`
- **Binary → Decimal conversion**  
  Example: `10 (bin)` → `2`
- **Case transformations** `(up)`, `(low)`, `(cap)` with optional counts `(up, N)`  
  Example: `Ready, set, go (up)!` → `Ready, set, GO!`
- **Punctuation normalization** (commas, ellipsis, question marks, etc.)
- **Quote formatting**  
  Example: `' word '` → `'word'`
- **Article correction**  
  Example: `a untold story` → `an untold story`
